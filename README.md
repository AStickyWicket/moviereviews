# Assignment #1 (15 marks) 
### ( 7.5% of final mark)
### Due Monday Feb 20th
For this assignment we are going to focus on the functionality of the react front end. You must use
github and git. I need to see a consistent record of commits so that I can see how you developed your
work. (For example, having one large commit where all the work is basically done is not acceptable)
As we are focusing on just react, there is no requirement to add styles to your assignment. There is a
bonus section to use a css framework. You may only do the bonus if you have all the other
requirements complete.
### Requirements:
Starting with the Create-React-App template build a simple React front end to store Movie Reviews. (Be
sure to place this initial project on github)
(The basics) /10
1. There will be 2 pages with links in a top navigation bar component. The first page is the movie
   reviews and the second is a page with a form to submit movie reviews. Use React-Router to handle
   moving between the two pages.
2. Each movie review should contain the following information:
    - Name
    - Release Date,
    - Actors,
    - Image of movie poster
    - Rating out of 5 stars
3. Your front end will load information regarding several movies from a .json data file.
4. Once loaded, You will use React Components to display all of the movies.
   ### (Stepping it up) /5
5. For each movie, add a “Remove” button. This button when pressed will remove the display of the
   movie. ( See pg 222 to 257 in book )
6. Add a form where the user can enter information for a movie review. The form when submitted will
   add the movie data to the front end and this new movie will be displayed. (See pg 257 to 271 in book)

For the image to be displayed, use a select element on the form to choose a placeholder or a specific
image for the movie you want to upload

#### (Bonus) /2 (May only attempt if completed all previous requirements)
Use react-bootstrap for css layout and styling
